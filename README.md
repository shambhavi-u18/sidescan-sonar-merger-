# sidescan-sonar-merger-
Image processing tool for combining port and starboard sidescan sonar images into a single mosaic. Used to support habitat mapping and riverbed visualization.

# Overview

Builds on the sonar image outputs generated by PINGMapper.
Each sidescan sonar ping produces two complementary images—one for the port side and one for the starboard side:

- Port side (`ss_port`)
- Starboard side (`ss_star`)

This tool merges these complementary perspectives into one mosaic by:

1. Loading both PNG images  
2. Automatically adjusts output height: padding the shorter image (no cropping)  
4. Saving the stitched result as a single PNG

# Features

- Works with PINGMapper `src` PNG exports   
- Clean left–right alignment of port and starboard images 
- Easy to modify or extend for larger sonar projects

# Requirements

- Python 3.8+  
- Pillow (PIL)
